        <p>The past few years of freelancing, I mainly work with startups and entrepreneurs who don&#x27;t usually have a design or technology team, so I wear a lot of different hats for clients.<br><br>I know not coming from a traditional Product Design background, I don&#x27;t have the traditional portfolio you&#x27;re probably use to seeing. It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t use and invest in design, for example I was in Matt Smith&#x27;s first cohort of his Shift Nudge Design course, but my work doesn&#x27;t entail full design processes.<br><br>While I do once in a while upload some work to <a href="https://dribbble.com/jreichenstein" target="_blank">Dribbble</a>, I wanted to do a mock case study to show the beginning of redesigning and prototyping some screens to help give you an insight to how I think about things that you might normally look for in a portfolio.<br><br>For this, I&#x27;m going to start the process as if the University of Rochester has just hired me to redesign their patient portal, <a href="https://mychart.urmc.rochester.edu/MyChart/Authentication/Login?" target="_blank">MyChart</a>.

          <div>Of course I&#x27;d love to include more in the process like research, testing, interviews, but for time, we&#x27;ll dive right in!<br><br>There are a few problems starting with the login page that I knew were issues to tackle.<br><br>1. There&#x27;s really no focal point of the page, no where your eye is drawn to or clear CTA leading you where you might want to go next.<br><br>2. The messaging and information are taking up that vast majority of the page, While this is great for your first time, the majority of users on this page will be here to just sign into their account.<br></div>

        <div class="content-width-medium">
          <div>I wanted to try a high contrast design, to keep things clear and also make sure it is easily readable and accessible to all users. Most of the previous site passed accessibility contrast ratings, however there were some areas that failed, like the light blue text links on the blue background. This is always an important part, but I feel even more so working in a healthcare space.<br><br>After mapping out what the different user journeys could be for coming to this page, I wanted to create a clear focal point for the case that will be the most common (signing in) using the yellow CTA, but then utilizing multiple buttons styles to break up the page and allow each action to stand out on it&#x27;s own still.<br><br>The last thing I want is to be overwhelmed when I&#x27;m only on the first screen of an app, so overall tried to keep this open and light. The information you need clearly presented in case you need it but not in the way.<br></div>

        <div class="content-width-medium">
          <div>To tackle the menu, I explored a slide out menu on the left, broken down by section, so you&#x27;re only presented with a few icons, making it less overwhelming that seeing all 20 + options as well.<br><br>Notification are also are key part of this dashboard, and it&#x27;s important we make sure user sees them before we dismiss them, so most probably won&#x27;t auto dismiss, but in the old system, notifications can pile up fast and take over a majority of the screen. With wanting to keep this organized, I added in a notification dropdown, in the yellow, to fully grab your eye at first, a focal point at first glance, but a design system that can adapt and grow in case a user doesn&#x27;t always clear out their notifications (I know I can be too lazy to &#x27;x&#x27; them out sometimes) but it still won&#x27;t interfere with there overall experience.<br><br>The majority of the Home Screen is designed to be useful right of the box, but also grow and adapt with you. The &quot;Quick Actions&quot; could be set by default to the most common actions but designed modularly so there&#x27;s the potential to have these adapt and change as you use your account to predict what you might want a shortcut to. Similarly with the &quot;Your health at a glance&quot; it&#x27;s designed so you can make your home page work for you, or an area a healthcare provider could pin markers he/she wants you to pay attention to.<br></div>
